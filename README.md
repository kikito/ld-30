# Earth, Hell & Space

### A game made for [Ludum Dare #30](http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-30/)

This is my Entry for the Ludum Dare compo, themed "Connected Worlds"

Here is the Compo submission page:

## Context

Push the Mystical Balls to their destinations! Earth and Hell are connected in subtle ways. Can you complete the game in as little steps as possible?

## Gameplay

This game is a Sokoban-like, in which you have to push around balls to win. The twist is that this game has two boards (two "worlds"). They are interconnected in several
ways.

## Controls

* Arrow keys: Move characters
* R: Restart level
* Esc: Back / Exit
* Space: (or any other key) Switch between Earth and Hell

## Hints

* Balls can be pushed but not pulled
* Humans and demons can move freely in Earth and Hell, but Aliens are quantum-locked and move the same way in both worlds.
* Green balls are similarly quantum locked.

## Misc

This game was made with [LÃ–VE](http://love2d.org).

I used Gimp for the graphics, [bfxr](http://www.bfxr.net/) + [Audacity](http://audacity.sourceforge.net/) for the sounds, and [Soundbox](http://sb.bitsnbites.eu/) for the music.
